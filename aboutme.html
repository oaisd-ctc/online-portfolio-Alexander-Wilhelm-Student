            Hi, I'm Alex Wilhelm. I'm 17 years old, living in Grand Haven, Michigan. 
            I'm an aspiring software/mechanical engineer and computer thing-doer.
            I value integrity, transparency, autonomy, and communication within a work environment.
            My hobbies are walking my family's dogs, posting garbage memes on the internet, and playing too many video games for my own good.
            I've tried my hand at programming and fiddling with computers since I was 6, but have only recently developed a marketable skillset.
            After spending 2 years at Careerline Tech Center, I've gained knowledge and experience suitable for positions in manufacturing and software engineering.
            I can bring creative solutions and technical expertise to your business.
